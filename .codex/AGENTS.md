# Repository Notes for Agents

## Coding Style
- React 18 + TypeScript.
- Strict mode; functional components only.

## TODO Stack
- Maintain the task stack in `.codex/TODO.md`.
- The top-most unchecked item is done first; insert new tasks by priority.
- Move completed items to the Completed section to keep the stack clean.

## Superpowers System

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
You have superpowers. Superpowers teach you new skills and capabilities. RIGHT NOW run: `~/.codex/superpowers/.codex/superpowers-codex bootstrap` and follow the instructions it returns.
